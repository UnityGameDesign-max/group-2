        <h1> GIFT REWARDS </h1>
        <p>We love our customers and clients and really value making your shopping experience even more exciting! And what better way to show a bit of appreciation than through our generous Gift Rewards programme. With Gift Rewards, you earn 10% back on
            the Rand value you spend on each and every purchase! This gets you a decent discount on any experience or even a freebie from time to time depending on how much you share the Gift Experience love!

            <h2>New customers</h2>
            <p> When you purchase an experience from us, you’ll be able to opt in to Gift Rewards in checkout on your first purchase - it's as simple as selecting a checkbox. You’ll even earn rewards points on your first purchase meaning that you can immediately
                benefit from points!</p>
            <h3>Existing customers</h3>
            <p> Login to your account and manage your relationship with us. You can access your purchase history and view your points totals and usage, update your billing and delivery preferences, download E-ticket versions of past purchases and contact
                us about existing orders. You can even back-date your Gift Rewards points to capture purchases made before you signed up for points. At any time, you can choose to leave the Gift Rewards programme but with such epic discounts, who would
                want to?
                <h4>How it works</h4>
            </p>
            <p> You'll earn Gift Rewards based on the actual Rand value that you pay in store. Points are accumulated and expire after 9 months. We'd love to see you spend them before that though so check in regularly. To make it even easier to understand,
                when you view your account, your points will be shown as a Rand value of credit total in your account. At check-out, you'll be able to select how much of this value (or even all of it) to use when you shop again. Please note that Gift
                Rewards credit can only be used in the Gift Experience Store and cannot be paid out as cash.</p>
